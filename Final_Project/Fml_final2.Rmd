## First CSV file and Required Packages are loaded 

In this project, we use the k-means clustering technique to do a non-hierarchical cluster analysis.
The goal here is to divide the data into homogeneous clusters from which we may extract meaningful information.
Let's start by loading the required packages and the original data set.

```{r results='hide'}
#packages are loaded 
library(caret)
library(factoextra)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
#Reading the dataset
library(readr)
fuel_receipts_costs_eia923 <-read.csv("fuel_receipts_costs_eia923.csv")
head(fuel_receipts_costs_eia923)
colMeans(is.na(fuel_receipts_costs_eia923))
  View(fuel_receipts_costs_eia923)
  
  library(dplyr)
fuel_receipts_costs_numerical<-fuel_receipts_costs_eia923[,c(1,2,12,13,15,16,17,18,20)]

fuel_receipts_costs_numerical<-sample_n(fuel_receipts_costs_numerical,12000)

Na<- fuel_receipts_costs_numerical %>% replace(.=="",NA)
new<-na.omit(Na)
```
1)Using only the numerical variables (1,2,12,13,15,16,17,18,20) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in 
conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) 
used, the number of clusters formed, and so on. 

Focusing on a subset of the original data set that it only contains numerical variables for the first part of the assignment.



## Normalizing and Clustering the data

I compute the distance between each observation in this part. Because the Euclidean distance metric is utilized by default and is scale sensitive, data must first be modified.

```{r}
#normalizing data
norm.fuel_receipts_costs_eia923 <- scale(new)

```

The graph depicts how intensity of color varies with distance. The diagonal, as we would predict, has a value of zero since it represents the distance between two observations.

##Finding the optimal K value

When there are no external factors, the Elbow chart and the Silhouette Method are two of the most effective approaches for calculating the number of clusters for the k-means model. The former shows how cluster heterogeneity decreases when more clusters are introduced. The latter compares an object's similarity to its cluster to the other clusters.

```{r}
#Using elbow chart and silhouette method
WSS <- fviz_nbclust(norm.fuel_receipts_costs_eia923, kmeans, method = "wss")

Silho <- fviz_nbclust(norm.fuel_receipts_costs_eia923, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
plot_grid(WSS, Silho)

```

The plotted charts show that in the elbow method line occurs when k=2.
I am using the k-means method with k=2.
```{r}
#using k-means with k=2 for making clusters
set.seed(123)
KMeans_model <- kmeans(norm.fuel_receipts_costs_eia923, centers = 2)
KMeans_model$centers
KMeans_model$size
KMeans_model$withinss
fviz_cluster(KMeans_model, data = norm.fuel_receipts_costs_eia923)

mean_k3<- new %>% mutate(Clusters=KMeans_model$cluster) %>% group_by(Clusters) %>% summarise_all("mean")

View(mean_k3)
```
